      <description>&lt;p&gt;Join thousands of Canadians coast to coast to coast taking their first steps learning about application development.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With great design comes great responsibility. User experience (UX) design isn’t just about creating pretty or functioning websites - it’s about creative solutioning and trying to make people&amp;rsquo;s lives and experiences better.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As application designers, we need to remember that we aren&amp;rsquo;t designing products for ourselves, but for other people. Being a UX designer allows you to work with and problem solve for a variety of different people, and empathy plays a huge part in this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the future of education in a networked world?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this documentary screening and discussion, we will discuss Indian professor Sugata Mitra&amp;rsquo;s calls for a revolution in how and what we learn. With a global network of information a few clicks away, Mitra argues that the Victorian model on which our school systems are based is obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;School In The Cloud follows a three-year experiment as Mitra installs unmanned internet kiosks in locations ranging from remote villages in West Bengal to a school in northeast England, to enable children to self-organize their learning. The film explores the impact of Sugata’s work, predominantly through the experience of children in the remote Indian village of Korakati in the Ganges Delta.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last 30 years, the number of women entering Computer Science university programs has dropped from 50% to around 10%. Once in the program, women have a higher drop out rate than men.  And women graduating with Computer Science degrees often leave the field and pursue alternate careers. &lt;a href=&#34;https://refreshannapolisvalley.org/person/dr-randy-newman&#34;&gt;Dr Randy Newman&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://refreshannapolisvalley.org/person/cindy-trudel&#34;&gt;Cindy Trudel&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; have been actively researching this phenomenon over the last few years.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Smart Communities movement involves villages, towns and cities getting ubiquitously connected to the Internet, and using the connection to involve citizens in networked activities.  This movement argues that all the economic wealth created since WW2 has come from innovation - a networking activity that Smart Communities excel at.  Smart Communities have better economic growth, more sustainable life-styles, and better health care.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;i-Valley, a non-for-profit group working to put fast broadband networks into our communities, is bringing the Smart Community movement to our rural and remote regions.  Come hear from &lt;a href=&#34;https://refreshannapolisvalley.org/person/barry-gander&#34;&gt;Barry Gander&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;, co-founder of &lt;a href=&#34;https://refreshannapolisvalley.org/organization/i-valley&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;        i-Valley&#xA;    &#xA;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; talk about the Smart Community movement, and their work in the Annapolis Valley.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Project management seems to be one of those areas of necessary evil. Disconnected project managers who don&amp;rsquo;t really understand your work coupled with never ending meetings, charts, spreadsheets, forms, paperwork, complicated management software&amp;hellip;  Project management can feel like it is more of a barrier than a help to team productivity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://refreshannapolisvalley.org/images/event/project-management-sucks/dilbert.gif&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Mike Caplan, a reluctant Software Development Manager, will explore a lightweight tool for overseeing the project processes.  Based on a simple board, this technique helps visualize workflow, expose operational problems, and reduce wasted time from excessive multitasking.  Best of all, it is a team tool that helps decentralize project management to the group.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
