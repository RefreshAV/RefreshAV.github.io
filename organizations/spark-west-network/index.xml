      <description>&lt;p&gt;Behind every entrepreneurial success lie the stories of numerous failures. As a mindset, entrepreneurship is characterized by risk-taking, experimentation, and continually challenging oneself to produce meaningful results. It is also about learning from failure, and, where possible, finding new ways to tackle problems that eventually lead to success.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Join &lt;a href=&#34;https://refreshannapolisvalley.org/person/katelyn-bourgoin&#34;&gt;Katelyn Bourgoin&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;, a 3X founder/business owner turned growth strategist, for a discussion about how to think about entrepreneurship.
