      <description>&lt;p&gt;The world is bubbling over with data.   When analyzed, data can provide the inquiring mind with useful information that can suggest outcomes and support decision-making.  Be it the data generated about business practices, human behaviours, the biological world; being able to understand what your data is telling you is incredibly empowering.  &amp;ldquo;R&amp;rdquo; is a free, accessible, and powerful programming language that offers a suite of tools for data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our tour guide, &lt;a href=&#34;https://refreshannapolisvalley.org/person/trevor-avery&#34;&gt;Trevor Avery&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; — biostatistician, faculty member at Acadia University, and coordinator of &lt;a href=&#34;https://refreshannapolisvalley.org/organization/r-bar&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;        R-bar&#xA;    &#xA;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; — will provide us a primer on R. Through a series of examples, he will demonstrate the various strength of R in data analysis and data visualization.  No experience with programming is required to learn about what R can do for you. Just bring your inquiring mind.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Trevor Avery is a marine biologist (Ph.D.) and biostatistician (P.Stat.) with a variety of research interests. U. of Guelph was home for his undergraduate Honours, Acadia U. for an M.Sc. (under Mike Dadswell) and Memorial U. for his Ph.D. (with Joe Brown, r.i.p.); Currently he is back with Acadia as an Associate Professor cross appointed within the faculties of Biology and Mathematics &amp;amp; Statistics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Technology and analysis techniques (statistics) play a significant role in most of his research projects, but not all. Trevor&amp;rsquo;s research interests are broad covering ecology and pedagogy. Trevor also runs &lt;a href=&#34;https://refreshannapolisvalley.org/organization/r-bar&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;        R-bar&#xA;    &#xA;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;: Acadia&amp;rsquo;s scientific programming study group.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
