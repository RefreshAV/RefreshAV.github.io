      <description>Dr. Newman is a Cognitive Neuroscientist whose primary research interest is in understanding the brain mechanisms responsible for reading and speech processes using event-related potentials and eye tracking techniques. Current research is examining the impact of a word&amp;rsquo;s spelling on how quickly we recognize spoken words.
A secondary area of interest is in understanding factors responsible for the gender gap that persists in some areas of science, notably computer science and engineering.</description>
