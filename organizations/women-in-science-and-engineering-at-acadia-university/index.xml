      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dr. Newman is a Cognitive Neuroscientist whose primary research interest is in understanding the brain mechanisms responsible for reading and speech processes using event-related potentials and eye tracking techniques. Current research is examining the impact of a word&amp;rsquo;s spelling on how quickly we recognize spoken words.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A secondary area of interest is in understanding factors responsible for the gender gap that persists in some areas of science, notably computer science and engineering. Current research is examining the impact of girls only science-based activities (e.g., camps) on girls&amp;rsquo; career aspirations in science, as well as on their self-efficacy and their sense of belonging in science-based disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
