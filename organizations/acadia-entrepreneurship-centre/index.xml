It is also about learning from failure, and, where possible, finding new ways to tackle problems that eventually lead to success.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Join &lt;a href=&#34;https://refreshannapolisvalley.org/person/katelyn-bourgoin&#34;&gt;Katelyn Bourgoin&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;, a 3X founder/business owner turned growth strategist, for a discussion about how to think about entrepreneurship.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Just like becoming an expert in wine - you learn by drinking it, the best you can afford - you learn great food by finding the best there is, whether simply or luxurious. Then you savor it, analyze it, discuss it with your companions, and you compare it with other experiences&amp;rdquo; - Julia Child, &lt;em&gt;Mastering the Art of French Cooking&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is lots of buzz around coworking spaces as a new way for independent and SME creative professionals to engage work. Coworking is about shared office space for professionals, but it is also about a style of work that suggests there are greater opportunities working in a diverse community setting. Coworking spaces themself are diverse in structure, ranging from the community powered, real-estate centric, to highbred business incubators.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In rural Nova Scotia, numerous coworking spaces are springing up. The HUB South Shore in Mahone Bay, L-Ink&amp;rsquo;d in Annapolis Royal, CO3 in Bridgewater, The Hub Yarmouth, The Hub Annapolis Valley, the Rural Innovation Centre at Acadia University. Wow!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
