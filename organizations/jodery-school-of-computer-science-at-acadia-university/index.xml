      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last 30 years, the number of women entering Computer Science university programs has dropped from 50% to around 10%. Once in the program, women have a higher drop out rate than men.  And women graduating with Computer Science degrees often leave the field and pursue alternate careers. &lt;a href=&#34;https://refreshannapolisvalley.org/person/dr-randy-newman&#34;&gt;Dr Randy Newman&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://refreshannapolisvalley.org/person/cindy-trudel&#34;&gt;Cindy Trudel&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; have been actively researching this phenomenon over the last few years. In this Refresh Annapolis Valley talk, Randy and Cindy will discuss the problem, the programs that Acadia has in place, and the needs for the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With an estimated 218,000 new skilled ICT workers needed in Canada by 2020 to meet the short term demands of our digital economy, focus on our educational system to address this challenge is paramount. The profound lack of diversity within the digital tech economy further complicates the response required. With changes in our provincial educational pipeline well under way, we are still early on in deploying a comprehensive response.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Join our panel discussion focused on defining challenges and solutions for Computer Science education today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
