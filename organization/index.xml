As a website and future mobile app, this technology-based company is innovating the traditional touring model for performers, live performances, and fan experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Artists and Hosts sign up for free online through the Side Door website by creating profiles and answering questions about their preferences for performing or presenting a show in a house or alternative space (think bookstores, warehouses, parks, libraries, community centres, etc). The platform automatically matches Artists and Hosts based on their mutual profile preferences. Once matched, they are notified of the match, and prompted to discuss the details of booking a show together. Not only is Side Door a booking tool, but the online platform also has a booking contract and ticketing component that allows the Host to advertise and sell tickets. Fans will be able to visit the website or download the app to view shows in their area and shows they have been invited to, and they can buy tickets instantly online. Once the show is over the Host, Artist, and fans are all asked to provide feedback on the attended show.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We believe that rural Nova Scotia is a great place to be an entrepreneur. However, there is much need for improvement. There are gaps in our Western Nova rural ecosystem that we wish to tackle:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;unified-voice&#34;&gt;Unified Voice&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is no unifying voice that pulls together the diverse organizations, events, and opportunities present in the Annapolis Valley, and sister municipalities. As individuals interested in what this community offers to entrepreneurs and creative professionals, it can be challenging to keep on top of what is going on of interest. This greatly limits regional organizations’ ability to reach out to our community.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
