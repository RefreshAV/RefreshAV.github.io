Being a UX designer allows you to work with and problem solve for a variety of different people, and empathy plays a huge part in this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Teric grew up in Halifax, Nova Scotia. He ran a small vegetable farm in Lunenburg County, Nova Scotia for three years. He observed there were a lot of repetitive tasks on farms that were consuming farmers’ resources. These repetitive tasks seemed like good candidates to be automated. After talking with other vegetable farmers, it became clear that weeding was a massive problem that could be solved by a robot. In May of 2017, Teric founded Nexus Robotics with his close friend who is a computer engineer, Jad Tawil. Teric’s experience on the farm has been valuable for guiding product development at Nexus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In this introductory workshop to Python programming, you’ll learn the vital stepping stones to controlling hardware using the Circuit Playground microcontroller (microcomputer) with one of the most robust, versatile, and popular programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-a-circuit-playground&#34;&gt;What is a Circuit Playground?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Circuit Playground is a microcontroller, or a tiny computer. This computer can easily be programmed to interact with hardware that you connect to it. Not only that, but the Circuit Playground comes equipped with various electronics and other hardware already built into it. It has multiple sensors (motion sensors, temperature sensors, sound sensors, etc), an infrared receiver/transmitter, push buttons, a speaker, input/output pins (by which you would attach external hardware to), a micro USB port, and several LEDs all on a 5 cm in diameter circuit board!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

With a global network of information a few clicks away, Mitra argues that the Victorian model on which our school systems are based is obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;School In The Cloud follows a three-year experiment as Mitra installs unmanned internet kiosks in locations ranging from remote villages in West Bengal to a school in northeast England, to enable children to self-organize their learning. The film explores the impact of Sugata’s work, predominantly through the experience of children in the remote Indian village of Korakati in the Ganges Delta.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Smart Communities movement involves villages, towns and cities getting ubiquitously connected to the Internet, and using the connection to involve citizens in networked activities.  This movement argues that all the economic wealth created since WW2 has come from innovation - a networking activity that Smart Communities excel at.  Smart Communities have better economic growth, more sustainable life-styles, and better health care.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;i-Valley, a non-for-profit group working to put fast broadband networks into our communities, is bringing the Smart Community movement to our rural and remote regions.  Come hear from &lt;a href=&#34;https://refreshannapolisvalley.org/person/barry-gander&#34;&gt;Barry Gander&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;, co-founder of &lt;a href=&#34;https://refreshannapolisvalley.org/organization/i-valley&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;        i-Valley&#xA;    &#xA;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; talk about the Smart Community movement, and their work in the Annapolis Valley.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Project management seems to be one of those areas of necessary evil. Disconnected project managers who don&amp;rsquo;t really understand your work coupled with never ending meetings, charts, spreadsheets, forms, paperwork, complicated management software&amp;hellip;  Project management can feel like it is more of a barrier than a help to team productivity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://refreshannapolisvalley.org/images/event/project-management-sucks/dilbert.gif&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Mike Caplan, a reluctant Software Development Manager, will explore a lightweight tool for overseeing the project processes.  Based on a simple board, this technique helps visualize workflow, expose operational problems, and reduce wasted time from excessive multitasking.  Best of all, it is a team tool that helps decentralize project management to the group.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

As a website and future mobile app, this technology-based company is innovating the traditional touring model for performers, live performances, and fan experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Artists and Hosts sign up for free online through the Side Door website by creating profiles and answering questions about their preferences for performing or presenting a show in a house or alternative space (think bookstores, warehouses, parks, libraries, community centres, etc). The platform automatically matches Artists and Hosts based on their mutual profile preferences. Once matched, they are notified of the match, and prompted to discuss the details of booking a show together. Not only is Side Door a booking tool, but the online platform also has a booking contract and ticketing component that allows the Host to advertise and sell tickets. Fans will be able to visit the website or download the app to view shows in their area and shows they have been invited to, and they can buy tickets instantly online. Once the show is over the Host, Artist, and fans are all asked to provide feedback on the attended show.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

As individuals interested in what this community offers to entrepreneurs and creative professionals, it can be challenging to keep on top of what is going on of interest.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Powered by open source hardware and software, students, engineers, and garage tinkerers alike are hacking the physical world. Using inexpensive “mini computers” like the Arduino, these makers are building interactive devices that can sense and control other physical objects. In this presentation, we will look at opportunity the Open Source Hardware Movement has created for everyday people to hack our technological world. &lt;a href=&#34;https://refreshannapolisvalley.org/person/ian-mckay&#34;&gt;Ian McKay&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; will introduce us to hacking the Arduino with a newbie how-to. We will do a live build of a project, playing with sensors, controlling devices and mad scientist programming.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is lots of buzz around coworking spaces as a new way for independent and SME creative professionals to engage work. Coworking is about shared office space for professionals, but it is also about a style of work that suggests there are greater opportunities working in a diverse community setting. Coworking spaces themself are diverse in structure, ranging from the community powered, real-estate centric, to highbred business incubators.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In rural Nova Scotia, numerous coworking spaces are springing up. The HUB South Shore in Mahone Bay, L-Ink&amp;rsquo;d in Annapolis Royal, CO3 in Bridgewater, The Hub Yarmouth, The Hub Annapolis Valley, the Rural Innovation Centre at Acadia University. Wow!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The recent and explosive growth in maker-culture combined with the emergence of 3D Printing in Fabrication Laboratories (or “FabLabs”) presents an opportunity for the province to prepare for the future by investing in economic and cultural change in rural Nova Scotia. Acting in concert with the Acadia Entrepreneurship Centre and the Centre for Rural Innovation, Acadia’s new STEAM Space is working toward the creation of a Maker Space/FabLab on the Acadia University campus. It will be based on the combination of Acadia’s knowledge in Science and Technology with expertise in business for the purposes of developing an Entrepreneurial culture of innovation for Artisanal Making. It is designed to turn disruption into opportunity for the local and regional community in which Acadia is embedded. David and Terry will talk about the potential of maker spaces, as well as provide some 3D printing show and tell.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
