      <description>&lt;p&gt;Whoop Whoop! You found me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have been starting businesses since I was 12, When I hijacked my moms old laptop to entertain myself while we lived in a barn. A few months later I accidentally started a business connecting people online playing a game that I loved. As a kid I sold Christmas trees, made maple syrup, started volunteer groups, and played in the woods.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now I have an amazing team and a real vision.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Teric grew up in Halifax, Nova Scotia. He ran a small vegetable farm in Lunenburg County, Nova Scotia for three years. He observed there were a lot of repetitive tasks on farms that were consuming farmers’ resources. These repetitive tasks seemed like good candidates to be automated. After talking with other vegetable farmers, it became clear that weeding was a massive problem that could be solved by a robot. In May of 2017, Teric founded Nexus Robotics with his close friend who is a computer engineer, Jad Tawil. Teric’s experience on the farm has been valuable for guiding product development at Nexus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
