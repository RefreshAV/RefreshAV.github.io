      <description>For this popup Startup Life entrepreneur chat over beers, we will be hosting Avery Schrader, a Nova Scotian living abroad in Tallinn, Estonia. Estonia, for those not in the know, is a tiny Baltic state, but in tech terms it&amp;rsquo;s a giant. It has a population of just 1.3 million, yet produces more start-ups per head than any other country in Europe.
Avery is the founder of Modash, a tool that enables marketing teams to find and verify the audiences of over 50,000,000 influencers globally.</description>

      <description>Whoop Whoop! You found me.
I have been starting businesses since I was 12, When I hijacked my moms old laptop to entertain myself while we lived in a barn. A few months later I accidentally started a business connecting people online playing a game that I loved. As a kid I sold Christmas trees, made maple syrup, started volunteer groups, and played in the woods.
Now I have an amazing team and a real vision.</description>
