      <description>&lt;p&gt;Refresh is a community of designers, developers and innovators working to refresh the creative, technical, and professional culture of digital technology endeavours in the Annapolis Valley while promoting design, technology, and entrepreneurship.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Refresh Annapolis Valley was founded to create a cultural and educational space for our regional digital technology professionals, both current and future, to grow their skills and build regional synergies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We believe deeply in the digital economy as a component of a strong diversified Nova Scotian economy.  Information and Communication Technologies have revolutionized traditional industries and spawned new ones.  As we shift from the Information Age to the Age of Artificial Intelligence, there are tremendous opportunities to solve problems across wide industry segments while generating opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
