      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Canadian Intellectual Property Office (CIPO), a Special Operating Agency (SOA) associated with Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, is responsible for the administration and processing of the greater part of intellectual property in Canada. CIPO&amp;rsquo;s areas of activity include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patents cover new inventions (process, machine, manufacture, composition of matter), or any new and useful improvement of an existing invention;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A trademark is a word (or words), a design, or a combination of these, used to identify the goods or services of one person or organization and to distinguish these goods or services from those of others in the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copyright provide protection for artistic, dramatic, musical or literary works (including computer programs), and three other subject-matter known as: performance, sound recording and communication signal;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industrial designs are the visual features of shape, configuration, pattern or ornament (or any combination of these features), applied to a finished article of manufacture;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Integrated circuit topographies refer to the three-dimensional configurations of electronic circuits embodied in integrated circuit products or layout designs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
