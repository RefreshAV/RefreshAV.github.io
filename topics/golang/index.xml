      <description>&lt;p&gt;Computer programming is the art, craft and science of writing programs which define how computers operate. This workshop, lead by Jodrey School of Computer Science alumn &lt;a href=&#34;https://refreshannapolisvalley.org/person/tim-cooper&#34;&gt;Tim Cooper&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;, will teach you how to write computer programs using a programming language designed by Google named Go.  Learn the basics as we design an AI to interact in a multiplayer game with the other participants in the workshop.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Go is a general purpose programming language with advanced features and a clean syntax. Because of its wide availability on a variety of platforms, its robust well-documented common library, and its focus on good software engineering principles, Go is an ideal language to learn as your first programming language.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
