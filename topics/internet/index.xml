      <description>What is the future of education in a networked world?
In this documentary screening and discussion, we will discuss Indian professor Sugata Mitra&amp;rsquo;s calls for a revolution in how and what we learn. With a global network of information a few clicks away, Mitra argues that the Victorian model on which our school systems are based is obsolete.
School In The Cloud follows a three-year experiment as Mitra installs unmanned internet kiosks in locations ranging from remote villages in West Bengal to a school in northeast England, to enable children to self-organize their learning.</description>
