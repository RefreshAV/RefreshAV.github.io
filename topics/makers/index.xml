      <description>“Creative Technician”&amp;hellip;what the heck is that?
I see my role, primarily, as that of a possibilitist. I listen closely to your ideas, what you hope to create, the problem you are working and then share with you the possibilities technology may offer. My years of immersion in Maker culture, joyfully exploring new and unusual uses for the wonders of emerging and age-old tech, provide me with a deep pool of possible solutions to your creative problems.</description>

      <description>Once upon a time, he was born. What happened after this is the interesting part. Relatively speaking. After his long and tedious early childhood, Max found himself being introduced to the fascinating world of technology. One of his earliest experiences was with the beginner programming environment known as Scratch. After a couple of years of making awesome scratch projects, Max moved on to explore more that tech had to offer. Through his School he found himself on a Lego Robotics team for a couple years.</description>
