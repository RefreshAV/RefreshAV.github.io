      <description>Join thousands of Canadians coast to coast to coast taking their first steps learning about application development.
With great design comes great responsibility. User experience (UX) design isn’t just about creating pretty or functioning websites - it’s about creative solutioning and trying to make people&amp;rsquo;s lives and experiences better.
As application designers, we need to remember that we aren&amp;rsquo;t designing products for ourselves, but for other people. Being a UX designer allows you to work with and problem solve for a variety of different people, and empathy plays a huge part in this.</description>
