      <description>Scratch is being used in thousands of schools around the world to teach kids about the Computer Sciences. Since its launch over 10 years ago, kids from Elementary to High School have created over 6 million projects. In this crash course, adults (parents and educators) will learn about the Scratch programming environment and how it might be used to introduce learners to the Computer Sciences. No coding experience required.
