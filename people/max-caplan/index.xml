      <description>In this teen Hoist mini series, you will learn about how to build your own web application. Web applications are unlike traditional websites. Traditional websites are largely informational (like the Refresh Annapolis Valley website) where web applications solve particular problems (think Gmail for email).
 In part 1, you will learn the ins-and-outs of building app interfaces In part 2, you will learn how to add interactivity to your web app In part 3, you will learn how to manage app data  If you haven&amp;rsquo;t attended part 1 or 2, you can jump right into part 3.</description>
