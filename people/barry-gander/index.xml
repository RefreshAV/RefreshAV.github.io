      <description>The Smart Communities movement involves villages, towns and cities getting ubiquitously connected to the Internet, and using the connection to involve citizens in networked activities. This movement argues that all the economic wealth created since WW2 has come from innovation - a networking activity that Smart Communities excel at. Smart Communities have better economic growth, more sustainable life-styles, and better health care.
i-Valley, a non-for-profit group working to put fast broadband networks into our communities, is bringing the Smart Community movement to our rural and remote regions.</description>
