      <description>&lt;p&gt;With an estimated 218,000 new skilled ICT workers needed in Canada by 2020 to meet the short term demands of our digital economy, focus on our educational system to address this challenge is paramount. The profound lack of diversity within the digital tech economy further complicates the response required. With changes in our provincial educational pipeline well under way, we are still early on in deploying a comprehensive response.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Join our panel discussion focused on defining challenges and solutions for Computer Science education today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Project management seems to be one of those areas of necessary evil. Disconnected project managers who don&amp;rsquo;t really understand your work coupled with never ending meetings, charts, spreadsheets, forms, paperwork, complicated management software&amp;hellip;  Project management can feel like it is more of a barrier than a help to team productivity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://refreshannapolisvalley.org/images/event/project-management-sucks/dilbert.gif&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Mike Caplan, a reluctant Software Development Manager, will explore a lightweight tool for overseeing the project processes.  Based on a simple board, this technique helps visualize workflow, expose operational problems, and reduce wasted time from excessive multitasking.  Best of all, it is a team tool that helps decentralize project management to the group.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
