      <description>Computer programming is the art, craft and science of writing programs which define how computers operate. This workshop, lead by Jodrey School of Computer Science alumn Tim Cooper , will teach you how to write computer programs using a programming language designed by Google named Go. Learn the basics as we design an AI to interact in a multiplayer game with the other participants in the workshop.
