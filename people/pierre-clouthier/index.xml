      <description>Recent advances in consumer genetics have enabled genealogists to solve mysteries in their family tree. Adoptees are finding their biological families by sharing the results of DNA tests with Websites that match millions of individuals.
Progeny Genealogy&amp;rsquo;s Charting Companion software displays the relationship distance of family members, as a number in an easy to understand chart. CC can also empirically find an adoptee&amp;rsquo;s family with an algorithm that simulates placement and compares theoretical to laboratory DNA results.</description>
